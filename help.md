### Help / Volunteer

*Volunteering*

[Help With COVID-19](https://helpwithcovid.com/) is a community for tech workers (designers, software engineers, etc) looking to help or be helped with coronavirus related projects.

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is a social networking site that allows users to create groups and host group events based on a common interest. Many of the groups on meetup are community-service focused, such as teaching programming or walking sheltered dogs. Right now, during social distancing, there won't be group events to attend in person, but the site is still a great way to find virtual meetings and communicate with people in your area with similar interests.

Donate face masks via [#findthemasks](https://findthemasks.com/) to hospital staff. While you're at it, consider making face masks of your own. Be careful to do your research though. [There is a difference between a simple homemade facemask and the N95 standard face mask that medical personel use](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf).
