**Case Trackers**

 * [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) is an incredible resource for US Data as well as [state-level links](https://covidtracking.com/data/) directly to each state's COVID-19 page. The project also has spreadsheets available, and a [public API](https://covidtracking.com/api/) that provides results in JSON or CSV format. I use this API (or really, your browser uses it) in my [Coronavirus Statistics](http://www.codercowboy.com/coronasim/data.html) tool. (Thanks Demi!)
 * [My Coronavirus Statistics Tool](http://www.codercowboy.com/coronasim/data.html) provides a detailed breakdown of the numbers provided by [the Covid Tracking Project's API](https://covidtracking.com/api/). It shows numbers at the US level and state level that are difficult to find easily elsewhere, such as the day to day increase percentage of new confirmed cases and hospitalizations. It also shows the percentage of hospitalizations compared to the number of confirmed cases.
