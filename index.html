	<h3>What?</h3>
	<hr class="my-4">

	<p>This is Jason's collection of information about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">CoronaVirus (COVID-19),</a> which is (was?) a global pandemic in 2020. For Jason, life during the pandemic often feels overwhelming due to the rapid and often confusing pace of information regarding the virus. Jason finds comfort in categorizing the information he's found, thus, this page exists.</p>



	<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
	<hr class="my-4">

	<p>Jason is not a trained scientist or doctor. This page is not an authority on <strong>anything</strong>, it's simply a collection of information that Jason hopes you might find useful. Do your own research. Listen to the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">WHO</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">CDC</a>, and be safe.</p>

	<p>Don't panic.</p>

	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing">Social distancing</a> is very important right now, especially if you are sick. These resources might help:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.instacart.com/">Instacart</a> is a grocery delivery service that will shop on your behalf and bring your groceries to you. The app allows you to select your groceries from a variety of local grocery chains in your area. It is especially helpful if you are not feeling well and need someone to bring supplies. Additionally, many grocery stores have their own delivery service or a pick-up service where you can pick the groceries up quickly without shopping: <a href="https://www.safeway.com/faq/online-shopping.html">Safeway / Albertsons</a>, <a href="https://grocery.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a>. Amazon also provides a grocery delivery service called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alm/storefront?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo">Amazon Fresh</a>.</p>

	<p>If you need over-the-counter medicine or other supplies delivered from your local pharmacy such as a Walgreens, CVS, or Rite-Aid, use <a href="https://postmates.com/">Postmates</a>. Postmates is primarily a service to order food delivery from restaurants, but they have also partnered with pharmacies as well.

	<p>There are a number of food delivery services that can pick up and bring you food from almost every restaurant and fast food chain in your city: <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/">Uber Eats</a>, <a href="https://postmates.com/">Postmates</a>, <a href="https://www.doordash.com/">Door Dash</a>, and <a href="https://www.grubhub.com/">GrubHub</a>.

	<p><a href="https://nextdoor.com/">NextDoor</a> provides internet forums for your neighborhood. It can be very a very useful way to ask for help or help someone.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> is a social networking site that allows users to create groups and host group events based on a common interest. Right now, during social distancing, there won't be group events to attend in person, but the site is still a great way to find and communicate with people in your area with similar interests.

	<p>If you're missing social contact with your friends and family. Consider video chatting with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204380">Facetime</a>, <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts</a>, <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">Facebook Messenger</a>, or <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>. Non-video group voice chats are also a popular option that are available on <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts</a>, <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>, and <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord.</a>

	<p>If you need to help someone fix their computer, screen sharing is possible with <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Hangouts</a> or <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>. For more hands-on control, consider <a href="https://www.logmein.com/">logmein</a>.</p>

	<p>Finally, some professional resources for working from home: <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a popular work chat option. Real-time remote collaborative document/spreadsheet sharing and editing is available via <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> or <a href="https://www.office.com/">Microsoft's Office365</a>. Sharing files between coworkers and your various devices (phones, tablets, computers) is easy with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>, <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">Microsoft's OneDrive</a>, or <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive's</a> apps for your phone or computer. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a> are popular options for source control if you aren't already hosting repos on your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>. Popular and inexpensive video conferencing options are <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, <a href="https://www.webex.com/">WebEx</a>, and <a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/">GoToMeeting</a> - each of these allow users to share their screen with each other.</p>

	<h3>News Sources</h3>
	<hr class="my-4">

	<h5>Official United States News Sources</h5>

	<p>These are the only sources that should be trusted for accuracy: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">The US Center For Disease Control (CDC)</a>, and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">The World Health Organization (WHO)</a>.

	<h5>Informal News Sources</h5>

	<p>The traditional news outlets, which can be sensationalist at times, that Jason trusts are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news">BBC</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>. 

	<p>Jason has primarily been getting his information from <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>, which is a crowd-sourced news aggregation site. There are several subreddits related to the the coronavirus. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/">r/coronavirus</a> is the primary (and informal) subreddit for information. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/">r/COVID19</a> is a subreddit that is strictly limited to scientific and reliably sourced information about the pandemic.</p>

	<p>Additionally, many regional subreddits exist.</p>

	<p>United States Regional Subreddits:</p>
	<ul>

	</ul>

	<p>World (Non-U.S.A.) Regional Subreddits:</p>
	<ul>

	</ul>

	<p>If you create a reddit account, you can create customized community feeds (multireddits) that aggregate a selection of subreddits in one place. Jason has several coronavirus related feeds that you can use without having a reddit account of your own:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ojfs/m/coronavirus_general/">General Coronavirus</a> - r/coronavirus + r/COVID19</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ojfs/m/coronavirus_us/">US Regional Coronavirus</a> - regional coronavirus subreddits for the United States</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ojfs/m/coronavirus_world/">World Regional Coronavirus</a> - regional coronavirus subreddits for countries other than the United States</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Coronavirus news is also posted often on <a href="https://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> which are tech-focused news aggregation sites similar to reddit. Slashdot, lately, has been overrun with spam-bots injecting fake conversations into the comments, and for that reason, Jason recommends following discussion on Hacker News instead.</p>
