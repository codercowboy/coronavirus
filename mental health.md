While the intention of this page is to provide factual data that Jason personally finds soothing to understand what's going on better, it's easy to be overwhelmed right now. It is very important to be vigilant and cautious while all of this is going on, but it's also very important to take care of yourself, be it through hobbies, memes, or anything else. And, of course a healthy diet, fresh air, good sleep and exercise are always incredible aids to mental health.

If you're struggling to find something to do rather than constantly refresh the news, consider these resources:

If your gym is closed, none of the [shelter in place](https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/what-does-shelter-in-place-mean.html) plans at this point ban taking a walk or jog outside, though be warned, <strong>in many states the state and city parks are closed, so stick to your neighborhood streets</strong>, and remember to socially distance yourself as you exercise. If lifting weights is more your thing, consider yoga, or plain old [calisthenics](https://www.google.com/search?q=calisthenics). There's a reason the United States physical education classes promote calesthenics - it works. Thanks, Nick, for that life advice!
